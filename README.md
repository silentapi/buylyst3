BuyLyst.co

BuyLyst.co is a full-stack Python + MongoDB + React application used by trading card game stores to manage their buylist intake, pricing, cart processing, and inventory importing.

Here is a step-by-step, technical walkthrough of the full buylist lifecycle using the "3x Fenrir" use-case ‚Äî with explicit backend endpoint calls, method types, input payloads, and the DB behavior involved at each step.

‚úÖ Step-by-Step: Selling 3x Fenrir ‚Äî Endpoint Flow


---

1. Customer wants to check if we're buying "Fenrir"

Action: Search the public buylist

Endpoint:
GET /buylist?name=fenrir
(optional: &categoryId=1, &groupId=123, etc.)

What Happens:

Matches enabled buylist entries

Applies emergency disables

Joins buylist_entries, products, and buylist_progress

Calculates:

remainingQuantity = maxQuantity - boughtQuantity - pendingQuantity

buyPrice = priceOverride OR priceMultiplier * marketPrice


Returns:


[
  {
    "internalId": "123-EN",
    "name": "Fenrir",
    "buyPrice": 5.00,
    "remainingQuantity": 10
  }
]

‚úÖ Implemented via routes/public_buylist.py


---

2. Customer registers an account

Endpoint:
POST /auth/register

Body:

{ "username": "fenrirfan", "password": "hunterxhunter" }

---

3. Customer adds 3x Fenrir to their cart

Endpoint:
POST /cart/add

Body:

{ "internalId": "123-EN", "quantity": 3 }

What Happens:

Validates that the product is enabled and not emergency-disabled

Loads buylist entry + progress

Ensures requested_quantity + bought + pending <= maxQuantity

Creates a draft cart if needed

Adds item or increments quantity

Price and condition stored on item

Audits the change


‚úÖ Implemented in public_cart.py


---

4. Customer submits the cart

Endpoint:
POST /cart/submit

What Happens:

Increments pendingQuantity in buylist_progress

Audits the action

If status is "submitted":

Compares items against current buylist availability

Flags any disabled or emergency-disabled items as "discontinued"



‚úÖ Implemented (with discontinuedItems list)


---

7. Emergency disable applied to "Fenrir"

Endpoint:
POST /admin/emergency/disable

Body:

{ "type": "product", "id": "123-EN" } // or type = "group", "category"

Adds entry to emergency_disables

Disables it from new add-to-cart actions and buylist visibility


‚úÖ Implemented (group/category only ‚Äî product-level not supported yet)


---

8. Customer comes in with cart ID

No endpoint call here ‚Äî they provide the cart ID to a store employee.


---

9. Employee processes the cart

Body:

{
  "items": [
    { "internalId": "123-EN", "quantity": 2, "condition": "Near Mint", "priceEach": 5.0 },
    { "internalId": "123-EN", "quantity": 1, "condition": "Lightly Played", "priceEach": 5.0 }
  ],
  "employeeName": "Tom",
  "notes": "1 lightly played",
  "payout": {
    "cashPercentage": 0.667,
    "creditPercentage": 0.333
  }
}
