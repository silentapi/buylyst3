# BuyLyst.co

</div>

BuyLyst.co is a full-stack Python + MongoDB + React application for trading card game stores to manage buylist intake, pricing, cart processing, and inventory importing. The platform enables customers to submit cards for sale, employees to validate physical cards, and managers to intake results into downstream inventory systems (e.g., Shopify).
