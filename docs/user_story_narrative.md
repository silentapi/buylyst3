# User Story Narrative

## Primary Personas
- **Customer (Seller)**: Trading card enthusiasts who want to sell cards to the store.
- **Intake Employee**: Staff receiving and validating cards dropped off or shipped in.
- **Inventory Manager**: Staff member responsible for reviewing processed carts and syncing inventory to downstream systems.
- **Administrator/Owner**: Oversees pricing strategy, system settings, and audit compliance.

## Scenario Overview
1. **Discovering the Buylist**: A customer navigates to the public buylist interface to check which cards the store is currently buying and at what price.
2. **Preparing a Submission**: The customer searches for cards, adds them to a cart, selects the intended condition and quantity, and reviews pricing rules and requirements.
3. **Submitting the Cart**: After verifying identity (account or guest as allowed), the customer submits the cart, chooses a drop-off or shipping option, and receives confirmation with next steps.
4. **Physical Intake**: The intake employee retrieves the submitted cart, verifies card conditions and quantities, adjusts payouts as necessary, and updates the cart status.
5. **Manager Review**: The inventory manager reviews processed carts, makes corrections for any discrepancies, and confirms carts are ready for inventory intake.
6. **Inventory Sync**: The manager aggregates approved carts into an inventory import, exports data in the required format (e.g., Shopify CSV), and marks the carts as completed.
7. **Continuous Improvement**: Administrators analyze spend analytics, adjust buylist pricing, manage emergency disables, and audit actions to keep operations compliant and profitable.
