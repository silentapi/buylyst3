# Long-Term Implementation Plan

## Phase 0: Foundations (Weeks 0-2)
- Finalize project requirements, architecture diagrams, and development environment setup.
- Establish repository structure, coding standards, and contribution guidelines.
- Configure CI/CD pipeline with linting, testing, and security scans.
- Provision development MongoDB instance and seed sample data.
- Implement authentication scaffold (JWT, user roles) and base React app shell.

## Phase 1: Public Buylist & Cart (Weeks 3-6)
- Integrate TCGCSV import scheduler and baseline product data ingestion.
- Build public buylist endpoints and React pages with search/filter UX.
- Implement cart drafting, validation, and submission flows.
- Add email notifications for submission confirmations.
- Write end-to-end tests covering customer journey.

## Phase 2: Employee Processing (Weeks 7-10)
- Develop employee queue, cart acceptance, and processing endpoints.
- Create processing UI with condition verification and payout calculators.
- Enable attachment uploads and secure storage.
- Implement audit logging for employee actions.
- Conduct usability testing with intake staff and refine workflows.

## Phase 3: Manager Review & Inventory Intake (Weeks 11-14)
- Build manager review dashboard and correction endpoints/UI.
- Implement inventory import batch creation and tracking.
- Generate export files (initial focus on Shopify CSV) with validation.
- Add reconciliation tools to compare processed vs corrected items.
- Expand automated test coverage to include manager workflows.

## Phase 4: Administration & Analytics (Weeks 15-18)
- Implement full buylist management UI and emergency disable controls.
- Build system settings pages with audit logging and guardrails.
- Deliver analytics dashboards and reporting APIs.
- Add data caching strategies for expensive analytics queries.
- Harden security (rate limiting, permissions audit, vulnerability scans).

## Phase 5: Deployment & Operations (Weeks 19-22)
- Prepare production deployment scripts/documentation (Docker, systemd, etc.).
- Configure monitoring (metrics, logs, uptime checks) and alerting.
- Establish backup/restore routines for MongoDB and file storage.
- Conduct load testing and performance tuning.
- Plan staged rollout with pilot stores, gather feedback, and iterate.

## Ongoing Initiatives
- Maintain TODO roadmap and planning documents as features ship.
- Schedule quarterly reviews of pricing algorithms and analytics efficacy.
- Continuously improve accessibility, localization, and documentation.
- Evaluate integration opportunities with additional marketplaces.
